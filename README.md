Best STAT 303 repository

We will be analyzing the 'spotify_data.csv' file.

Our goal is to create the best model to predict `track_popularity` with a different combinations/interactions/transformations of predictor variables in the dataset.

1) split the dataset into train data (all songs in all years except 2021) & test data (all songs in year 2021)
2) attempted to find an initial best fit model simply with predictors from the dataset
3) improved the model by using interactions and transformations with the predictors from the dataset
4) predictions: found the RMSE and RSE
5) used lasso model/ridge regression to try to create an even better model
6) interpreted our results & included recommendations
7) listed our next steps for possible further data analysis

We hope you enjoy our project!
